**A lightweight, community-driven CLI client for Bleach Brave Souls written in Go.**

## 📜 Project Idea

* Reverse-engineer and reproduce core network interactions of [Bleach: Brave Souls](https://www.bleach-bravesouls.com) in a simple, scriptable command-line interface.

## 🎯 Future Goals

* Expand to a fully-featured CLI with support for quests, farming routines, and player state queries.
* Modular architecture for easy addition of new features and protocols.

## 🛠️ Development Approach

* **Language**: Go ([Golang](https://go.dev)) for performance, concurrency, and cross-platform binaries.
* **Methodology**: Traffic interception ([mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org)) + protocol analysis (IL2CPP/Mono) + iterative Go implementation.

## 📚 Study-Only Disclaimer
